/**
 * This documentation also serves myself (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ I got hella confused in the process of avoiding unncessary operations. I love preserving performance as much as possible.
 * Basically, when shopBanLiftTime is present, a shop ban is active and no new purchase needs to be registered until it has run out.
 * LastBoughtTime is used to figure out the exact time of the ban once the user visits a shop with the ban message after a purchase.
 * The ban message is read and parsed, added on top of the last bought time (or current time if refresh ban), then registered as the shopBanLiftTime.
 * At this point, lastBoughtTime can be cleared up and only shopBanLiftTime should be used on every page to display the remaining ban in a container.
 * Once shopLiftBanTime has exceeded the current time, it should be reset and every purchase should be registered in case a ban might be detected again.
 *
 * This would be so much easier if there was an indication for a ban at the time of purchase, but I'm not going to maintain a list of items that will ban guaranteed, only to handle items that only have a chance to ban differently anyway.
 * Someone else who wants to save that bit of performance, feel free to use my code in a new script and add that. I don't want to bother with such crowdsourced maintenance.
